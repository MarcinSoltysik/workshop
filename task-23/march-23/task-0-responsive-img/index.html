        <h3>Adjusting the size of an image</h3>
        <article>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Adjusting the size of an image to the dimensions of the device in CSS is commonly referred to as
                responsive
                images. In
                responsive design, the goal is to create a website that can adapt to different screen sizes and device
                types,
                including
                desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

                To adjust the size of an image to the dimensions of the device, CSS provides a few different techniques.
                One
                common
                approach is to use the max-width property to set the maximum width of an image, while allowing the
                height to
                be flexible
                and adjust automatically. For example, you could use the following CSS:
              </p>
              <code>
            img {
              max-width: 100%;
              height: auto;
            }
          </code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This code sets the maximum width of the image to 100% of its container, and the height is set to auto,
                which
                allows the
                image to scale proportionally to fit the width of the container.

                Another approach is to use the srcset attribute to specify multiple versions of an image with different
                sizes
                and
                resolutions. The browser can then select the most appropriate image based on the device's screen size
                and
                resolution.
                For example:
              </p>
              <code><img src="small.jpg" srcset="medium.jpg 1000w,
            large.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 50vw" alt="Responsive image"></code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In this code, three different versions of the image are specified with different widths. The sizes
                attribute
                tells the
                browser how to select the appropriate image based on the device's screen size, and the alt attribute
                provides
                alternative text for users who can't see the image.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
